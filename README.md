# eBlocks-assessment
This is the repo that contains my JavaScript projects for the eBlocks assessment

# Projects
There are 3 projects in the repo, the Amazon Clone, Rock Paper Scissors, and Todo List.

## Amazon Clone
The Amazon clone is a clone of the Amazon website but it is not complete. The clone has several features that demonstrate my knowledge of JavaScript. It has features such as being able to browse a catalogue of items, add items to a cart and then view those items in the checkout page along with the total before and after tax.

## Rock Paper Scissors
The RPS project is a game that makes use of JavaScript to evaluate both the player and the computers moves and then it shows the winner after each round. There is also the auto-play feature where the game plays without stopping until the user stops it.

## Todo List
The Todo List is a project where a user can add a name of a task and the date and it will display it back to the user in list form. The user also has the option to delete an entry.
